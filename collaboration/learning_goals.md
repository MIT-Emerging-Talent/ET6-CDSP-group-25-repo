# Learning Goals

## Collective

As a team, we aim to:

- Get better at using data structures and algorithms through regular practice.
- Write cleaner, more readable code that others can easily understand.
- Work together smoothly using Git and GitHub — branches, pull requests,  
  and reviews.
- Give each other helpful feedback and stay connected with regular check-ins.
- Solve problems more quickly and clearly over time.
- Build solid coding habits like testing our work and improving messy code  
  when needed.
