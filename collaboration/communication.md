## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 â†’ 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 â†’ 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
