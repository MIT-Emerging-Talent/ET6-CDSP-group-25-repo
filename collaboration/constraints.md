# Constraints
Some boundaries around our project that guide scope, collaboration, and execution.

## External
- All project deliverables must be completed by the milestone deadlines defined in the syllabus.
- Workshop attendance is required by at least 2 team members per session.
- We must use GitHub as our primary collaboration platform (issues, pull requests, markdown files).
- Final deliverables must be accessible and clearly documented in the repository.

## Internal: Involuntary
- Team members are in different time zones, which may limit synchronous meeting times.
- Individual availability varies throughout the week (some can commit more on weekends).
- Some members are balancing this project with full-time work or studies.
- Technical equipment and internet access may vary across team members.

## Internal: Voluntary
- We will use pull requests for **all** contributions — no direct commits to `main`.
- At least one reviewer must approve a PR before merging.
- We will follow consistent commit message conventions (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`).
- Team members will log availability in the `COMMUNICATION.md` file.
- All meeting minutes will be recorded in `meeting_minutes.md`.
- We will scope our project to what can be realistically completed within 8–10 hours/week per person.
- We aim for clear, respectful, and inclusive communication in all channels.
- Team members will promptly raise any risks or blockers using GitHub issues or during check-ins.
